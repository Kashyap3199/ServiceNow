types of log files:

1. files on application nodes are called local host, threads and xml stats. which stores the transaction details

2.files on the table are called logs or transaction logs

Transaction logs: get values such as session, created by,system id (tells which node transaction happened on),URl. the 

stats.do: shows info about instance name, cluster node (same as system id)

deleted records are stored in sys_audit_delete table, if the table has audit set as true/

if the system id from transaction log is same cluster node, go to the node log browser, else go to node log file downloader.
